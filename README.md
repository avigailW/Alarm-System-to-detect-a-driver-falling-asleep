Alarm system is for bus and truck companies, identifies a driver who fell asleep while traveling with the help of a camera,
and immediately activates an alarm to wake the sleeping driver, at the same time sending a message to the site 
with the details of the driver and the time he fell asleep.

An alarm system is intended to diagnose the driver's entry into an emergency state in advance, 
while providing an alert to prevent the phenomenon from continuing to jeopardize the driver and other factors in the environment.
